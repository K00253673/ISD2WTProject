                        <h2>What is Meditation?</h2>

                        <p>Meditation is one path toward transforming the mind. Buddhist meditation
                            practices encourage and develop concentration, clarity, and emotional 
                            positivity. When you begin a meditation practice, you may learn the patterns
                            and habits of your mind. Meditation offers you a way to cultivate new and more 
                            positive ways to approach the things you do throughout your day. Meditation can
                            have a transformative effect and can lead to positive changes as well as a new 
                            understanding of life.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why Meditate?</h2>

                        <p>Be happy: Meditation causes the pituitary gland in 
                            your brain to secrete endorphins that help elevate 
                            mood and have a positive effect on the whole body.
                            Reduce stress: Endorphins also reduce stress levels 
                            in the brain. Focus: Through meditation you can 
                            learn self-discipline so your mind can focus with
                            increased efficiency. Sleep better: Scientific 
                            studies have shown that those who meditate enhance
                            their slow wave sleep pattern which can help fight insomnia.   
                            Lower blood pressure: Research has also shown that
                            meditation can reduce blood pressure, both in the 
                            short term and later in life.
                            Pain relief: The long term practise of meditation
                            can lead to physical changes in the brain that help 
                            alter the perception of pain.

                    <h2>Stress Relief</h2>

                    <p>We all encounter stress at one time or another. So it's important to be able 
                        to recognize stress and learn how to deal with it.</p>

                    <h2>What is stress?</h2>

                    <p>Stress is the feeling that people have when they are overloaded and 
                        struggling to cope with demands. Anything that poses a real or perceived 
                        challenge or threat to a person's well-being can cause stress.</p>

                    <p>Stress can also be a motivator. It can be essential to survival. 
                        The &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; mechanism helps us know when and how to
                        respond to danger. But when this mechanism is triggered too easily, or when 
                        there are too many stressors at one time, it can become harmful to a 
                        person's mental and physical health.</p>
